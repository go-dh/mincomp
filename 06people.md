**Jean Bauer** is the Associate Director of the Center for Digital Humanities at Princeton.  Through a combination of formal training and curiosity she is an early American historian, a database designer, dataviz enthusiast, and a photographer. Her dissertation “Republicans of Letters: The Early American Foreign Service as Information Network, 1775-1825” explores the research affordances of custom built digital platforms for the study of history, particularly [The Early American Foreign Service Database](www.eafsd.org) (code released as [ProjectQuincy](projectquincy.org)) which she built to conduct her analysis and maintains as an open access scholarly resource.  When not studying the relationship between power and information, Bauer seeks to share both through the big tent of Digital Humanities.

**Alex Christie** is a doctoral candidate in English at the University of Victoria. He conducts research on 3D geospatial expression and scholarly communication for the Modernist Versions Project (MVP) and Implementing New Knowledge Environments (INKE) in the Electronic Textual Cultures Lab (ETCL). He is developing an open source toolkit for digital humanities pedagogy with grant funding from the Association for Computers and the Humanities (ACH); his dissertation traces experiments in procedural literary expression across modernist poems and manuscripts.

**Gabriel Egan** is Professor of Shakespeare Studies and Director of the Centre for Textual Studies at De Montfort University in England. He is co-editor with Gary Taylor of the Authorship Companion to the New Oxford Shakespeare to be published in April 2016. In the course of evaluating recent scholarship in authorship attribution by computational stylistics, Egan has become interested in how literary students can be introduced to algorithmic thinking and helped to understand the means by which machines store and manipulate texts. For this pedagogy, minimalism is desirable.

**[Alex Gil](http://www.elotroalex.com)** is Digital Scholarship Coordinator for Humanities and History at Columbia University. He maintains a robust online and analog research presence on Caribbean literature and digital humanities. In 2010-2012 he was a fellow at the Scholars' Lab and NINES at the University of Virginia.

Her articles on digital pedagogy are available online in Postcolonial Digital Humanities and TECHStyle.

**[Nabil Kashyap](http://nabilk.com)** is the Digital Initiatives & Scholarship Librarian at Swarthmore College where he is also liaison to English Literature and Film & Media Studies. Mostly he designs, implements, and manages digital projects--recently a public history site engaging Black activism at Swarthmore and a web-app modeling the structure of Navajo for scholars, students and native speakers. He serves on the steering committee for digital humanities at the college and collaborating institutions. He is currently thinking about knowledge claims and algorithms, proselytizing for plaintext everything, and leveraging freely and widely available technologies towards a more capacious landscape of digital humanities projects and publics.

**Margaret Konkol** is Visiting Assistant Professor of American Literature and Poetry at New College of Florida, the public liberal arts honors college of Florida. Like Amanda Golden, she previously held a Marion L. Brittain Postdoctoral Fellowship in Digital Pedagogy at the Georgia Institute of Technology. Her book project combines computational methods and archival research in its investigation of how modernist poets looked toward public urban nature as a site of innovation for both poetic form and social practice. At New College she has co-organized a faculty digital pedagogy seminar and this fall is teaching an upper-level digital humanities course, “Technologies of the Book,” which includes familiarizing students with awls and arduinos. In addition, she is co-editing with Julia Daniel Modernism in the Green, a collection of essays on modernist engagement with public green space and her article “Public Archives, New Knowledge, and Moving Beyond the Digital Humanities/Digital Pedagogy Distinction" is forthcoming in Hybrid Pedagogy.

**Élika Ortega** is a Postdoctoral Researcher at the Institute for Digital Research in the Humanities at the University of Kansas. She writes about digital literature, (not necessarily digital) media, intermediality, materiality, reading practices and interfaces, books, networks, digital humanities, and multilingualism in academia. She also likes to bind books. Élika currently serves in the executive committee of GO::DH, the ACH executive council, and the Multi Lingual-Multi Cultural committee of ADHO. 


**[Roopika Risam](http://roopikarisam.com/)** is Assistant Professor of English at Salem State University, where she directs the undergraduate secondary education English licensure program and the graduate certificate program in digital studies. She is on the executive council of the Association for Computers and the Humanities and is an active member of GO::DH. Her interests include the intersections of postcolonial, Africana, and U.S. ethnic studies, the uses of digital platforms and tools for activism, and digital humanities in the high school classroom. As a result, she is interested in the pedagogical and applied possibilities of repurposing obsolete or existing technologies and spare parts towards intersectional, social justice-minded ends.

**Yairamaren Roman Maldonado** is a doctoral student in the Spanish and Portuguese Department at the University of California, Berkeley with a Designated Emphasis in New Media. Her research focus is literary and cultural production in the Caribbean and Latin America, with emphasis on colonization, the post-national subject and the politics of 21st Century non-canonical works in Puerto Rico. Currently working on the very first stages of developing an archival database of contemporary Puerto Rican works as part of her dissertation and researching online/offline production cultures in relation to the digital divide(s) in the Caribbean and the US. Her interest in minimal computing stems from matters regarding use and access of technology in relation to under-served communities and the production of digital projects in the context of the third world.

**Brian Rosenblum** is Associate Librarian at the University of Kansas Libraries where he currently serves as co-director of KU's [Institute for Digital Research in the Humanities](http://idrh.ku.edu).
