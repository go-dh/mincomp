I"A<p>[This paper was originally presented at the MLA 2017 conference as part of the Minimal Computing panel organized by Jentery Sayers. <a href="/mincomp/images/mcgrail-slides.pdf">Slides can be found here</a>.]</p>

<p>In April, I will teach what I believe will be the first stand-alone Intro to Digital Humanities course at a community college (CC) in the
Pacific Northwestâ€”maybe the first such course at a CC in the country. I call my course â€œThis Digital Life: Reading, Writing and Culture in a
Digital Age,â€ because my students donâ€™t know what â€œdigital humanitiesâ€ is.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote">1</a></sup></p>

<p>In this course, I will introduce my CC students to a way of thinking
about and comprehending the forces around themâ€”the forces that Alan Liu
calls the â€œgreat postindustrial, neoliberal, corporate and global flows
of information and capitalâ€ (Liu 491). Community college studentsâ€™ lives
are immersed in precarity wrought by these flows; only the grittiest of
them will overcome the bleak economic for economic mobility in America.
Articulating how those forces affect them is one of the most important
learning outcomes of DH at the CC.</p>

<p>But what are the minimal computing coordinates for CC students? And
where does open source fit in an open access environment? I hadnâ€™t
really thought of this before reading Alex Gilâ€™s and Jentery Sayersâ€™
definitions of â€œminimal computing;â€ I am unsure how to use Raspberry Pi
and I can barely work with Markdown templates. I do use whatever tools
are available and weâ€™ll read whatever open educational resources we can
find. Perhaps, following Gil and Ernesto Oroza, my community college DH
course will follow a kind of â€œarchitecture of necessity.â€</p>

<p>While the <em>surface</em> features of my course are not strictly â€œminimal,â€
they share <em>structural</em> affinities to the GO::DH values of maximum
access and longevity: My students might <em>read</em> Gilâ€™s and Sayerâ€™s pieces
but they will likely <em>write</em> about them using Google or Word on their
laptops and email me using Outlookâ€”transgressing minimal computing
principles at every keystroke. I think that these <em>definitions</em> of
minimal computing themselves point to a set of assumptions for
humanistic computing that are worth considering in CC studentsâ€™ digital
lives.</p>

<p>Iâ€™ve practiced not â€œminimalâ€ computing but what Roopika Risam calls
â€œmicro DH.â€ Since 2012, I have embedded whatever I could invent or learn
in all my courses, adopting and adapting from a generous DH Pedagogy
Community and translating research so that my students can appreciate
the cool factor of big data without slamming up against skill barriers
to data mining; and then I send students to Wordle or Voyant so they can
work the magic themselves. My students dive into archives and annotate
texts using Google docs. Sometimes we â€œbreakâ€ Google or Twitter because
our computer lab is equipped with lame machines and the systems crash.
The Computer Help Desk folks are so used to hearing from me about
glitches during class that they respond immediately when I call; if I
ever have a classroom emergency, itâ€™s them Iâ€™ll call first, not campus
security.</p>

<p><strong>Reconsiderations and a Maturing Field</strong></p>

<p>While minimal computing intends to create conditions for maximum
inclusiveness, I fear that in practice it may exclude underprepared
students in open-access institutions.</p>

<p>The minimalist turn registers the effects of uneven development in the
academy. Community colleges are just beginning to recognize the term
â€œdigital humanities,â€ and faculty are just beginning to figure out how
digital assignments fit into their courses. In many, although not all,
cases, â€œminimal computingâ€ assignments take maximal preparationâ€“for CC
faculty still untrained in the field and for unevenly prepared students.</p>

<p>Jentery anticipates the critique that minimal computing may produce
different impacts to different agents in an unevenly developing field.
He asks, â€œwhat sort of expertise and decision-making [does minimization
assume]â€ and how do â€œwe define â€˜weâ€™ in relation to necessity and
simplicity?â€ (â€œMinimal Definitionsâ€). Necessary for what? Simple for
whom? Under what constraints?</p>

<p>For community colleges, the purpose of humanities education is to
empower students with <em>as much</em> mastery of <em>as many</em> tools as possible
for <em>full participation</em> in civic and cultural life. How we define
â€œminimal computingâ€ at the CC needs to support that purpose.</p>

<p>For Iâ€™m not just talking about access to any particular set of digital
toolsâ€”whether â€œminimalâ€ or â€œmaximalâ€â€“in this regard. Rather, itâ€™s
studentsâ€™ <em>transformed understanding</em> that I am afterâ€”the crossing of a
threshold from accepting a received cultural landscape to a deep reading
of it. Open-access institutions may make use of â€œmaximalâ€ tools as a
<em>relay</em> for critically engaging with the digital life they lead. In so
doing, they may achieve ends that â€œminimal computingâ€ principles intend.</p>

<p>Participation, writes Carpentier, is â€œstrongly related to the power
logics of decision makingâ€ (8). Carpentierâ€™s foregrounding of power
relations and social capital helps us to situate values of minimal
computing in an open-access CC context. Looking at Jenteryâ€™s
comprehensive list of the features of minimal computing, we see that he
is going for a maximalist model of participation in stewardship of the
cultural record and in knowledge production and dissemination. The list
helps elaborate the question that Alex Gil asksâ€”that of â€œwhat do we
<em>need</em>?â€ â€“and imagines a DH architecture of necessity that ensures
scholarsâ€™ <em>maximal</em> role in decisions and maximal control of future use.</p>

<p>While community colleges share disciplinary affinities with their
counterparts at 4-year colleges and universities, these affinities mask
power differentials between CCs and their four-year counterparts.
Carpentierâ€™s focus on power provides language for recognizing the
differences between four-year institutions and CCs and for responding to
those differences.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote">2</a></sup> This power differential is visible in multiple
spheres, but here are a couple of examples to illustrate how it impacts
faculty and students at CCs: [slide 1]</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>First, graduate school doesnâ€™t train most humanities graduates for
the demands of CC teaching</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Second<strong>,</strong> graduate faculty rarely maintain close professional ties
with students who land jobs at CCs. I call this the â€œYouâ€™re dead to
meâ€ model of mentorship.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Effects of this dynamic on professional development have been to
create an hermetic CC professional world cut off in important ways
from developments in the larger field</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This dynamic limited what should have been a much earlier diffusion
of digital humanities methods into CC curricula.<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote">3</a></sup></p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Additionally</strong>, the role that contingency and precarity play in CC
faculty lives cannot be overstated. Part-time/adjunct faculty represent
nearly 70% of the instructional workforce of community colleges and 47%
of humanities educators overall (â€œA National Surveyâ€ and â€œTraditional
versus Nontraditional Humanities Facultyâ€). Many part-time or adjunct
humanities faculty teach given syllabi or are limited in the texts they
can select. Maximal equity in participatory decision-making in
curriculum is harder for contingent faculty to achieve.</p>

<p><strong>And what about CC students</strong>?</p>

<p>What might minimal computing look like for them and how might they
practice it? Student diversity is the open access institutionâ€™s best
asset and biggest challenge. <sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote">4</a></sup> Jentery raises the issue of time in
relation to reduced consumption (â€œMinimal Definitionsâ€); working class
time orientation is characterized by â€œprecarityâ€â€”a sense that struggles
in and endurance of the present are more salient than investments in a
future imaginary. You could say that CC priorities are driven by a
working class time orientation toward the â€œshort nowâ€ and not the â€œlong
nowâ€ thinking required of the minimal critical movement (â€œMinimal
Definitionsâ€).</p>

<p><strong>How else might â€œminimalâ€ computing impact studentsâ€™ full
participation?</strong> â€œCreative failureâ€ and â€œgenerative messing aroundâ€ may
directly challenge an already profound sense of what Walton and Cohen
call â€œbelonging uncertainty.â€ Experiences of failure that middle-class
students may simply slough off disparately impact minority studentsâ€™
sense of belonging and social â€œfitâ€ in college. CC students are already
â€œdoing the risky thingâ€ (Fitzpatrick)â€”theyâ€™re going to college.
Trialâ€”and especially <em>error</em>â€“around spartan and user-<strong><em>un</em></strong>friendly
interfaces can challenge even the most confident of lifelong learners.
Recently, I fell short of completing a Github pull request after many
tries, and I had the humbling experience of standing on the wrong side
of a threshold. Perhaps for CC students, commercial interfaces <em>are</em> the
â€œarchitecture of necessityâ€ (Gil)â€“ the best way to ensure that they
cross important thresholds when taking on digital projects.</p>

<p>When I was reading about minimal computing, the words â€œsyntactic sugarâ€
and â€œsyntactic saltâ€ popped up. This language of low-processing and
elemental design pepper minimal computing definitions and put me in mind
of the language of food politicsâ€“Whole Foods, organic produce, farmersâ€™
markets and distributed pantry movements. Why is it, I wondered, that
the advantages of bypassing the supermarket to ensure maximal autonomy
are only realized by middle-class families with huge domestic
square-footage and mini-vans? Do the conflicting urgencies of class and
environment operate in minimal computing?</p>

<p>If they do, what kind of computing can help CC students comprehend and
intervene in the high-speed, overprocessed environment of their â€œdigital
lifeâ€? Thinking of supermarkets led me to consider how McDonaldâ€™s,
Burger King, Taco Bell and KFC leverage food deserts for profit. I
looked up the Food Desert locator data visualization map posted by the
USDA [<strong>Figure 1 â€œFood Desert Mapâ€</strong>], and then quickly also found the
Fast Food restaurant map [<strong>Figure 2 â€œFast Food Locatorâ€</strong>]. Then I
went back to the GO::DH map that locates DH centers globally [<strong>Figure
3 â€œIn a Rich Manâ€™s World: Global DHâ€</strong>] and created my own DH at the CC
data viz map using Google Maps to see what it might reveal. This was
networked computing toward a local end [<strong>Figure 4 â€œThe Only CC Digital
Humanities Faculty in the PacNW Flies to the MLAâ€</strong>].</p>

<p>So Iâ€™m saying that â€œmaximumâ€ computing can serve â€œminimal computingâ€
ends of inclusiveness and participation, but I do know I need to avoid
creating conditions for CCs to become digital equivalents of food
deserts. A sole diet of Google, Microsoft, Twitter, Facebook, Instagram,
Snapchat et al. could play into a lifetime of dependence on
overprocessed commercial platforms. Meanwhile CC studentsâ€™ four-year
counterparts at Honors Colleges and First Year Interest Groups tinker
with their Tiny Linuxes, â€œhealthy choicesâ€ and â€œwhole foodsâ€ of
Raspberry Pi. But for now, thatâ€™s where my staircase ends.</p>

      <p>I want to acknowledge here the existence of many under-resourced
four-year colleges and universities as well, and that we are talking
about a complex system of power and privilege operating in higher
education. But CCs have an open-access mission and a lower-division
or foundational focus, and this puts them at a singular disadvantage
in terms of social capitalâ€”for students, for faculty within the
profession.Â <a href="#fnref:2" class="reversefootnote">&#8617;</a></p>

      <p>There are some hopeful signs on the horizon in this regard: The

      <p>CC Student facts: There are 992 public community colleges in the
US, and community college students make up 46% of all undergraduates
in the US and 41% of all first-time freshmen. Sixty-one percent of
Native American college undergraduates are enrolled in community
colleges; 52% of Black students and 43% of Asian/Pacific Islander

college students begin at community college. In the US, 59% of
community college students are enrolled part-time, and 59% are women
(American Association of Community Colleges, â€œEnrollmentsâ€). The SES
data on CC students are well known (Adelman): 44% percent of
low-income students attend community colleges as their first college
out of high school as compared to 15% of high-income students
(Community College Research Center). Sixty-nine percent of community
